ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jessie! I'm a graduate majored in Information Engineering and Media at Nanyang Technological University, and I like building small, thoughtful systems that work well for the people using them.  My github here is a collection of some side projects I've done after my day job as a business analyst, and also projects I've done while in school.
